# üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of analyzing network traffic and identifying various types of cyber-attacks such as **DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R**, as well as distinguishing them from normal activity. This system uses a **Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier** to achieve high accuracy in intrusion detection.
